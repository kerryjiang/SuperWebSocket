SuperWebSocket
==============

### SuperWebSocket is a .NET implementation of WebSocket server.

What is WebSocket?

WebSocket is a technology providing for bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels, over a single Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) socket.
It is designed to be implemented in web browsers and web servers but it can be used by any client or server application.
The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C and the WebSocket protocol is being standardized by the IETF.
Please refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSockets.


**SuperWebSocket** is being merged into SuperSocket as an additional module **SuperSocket.WebSocket**. You can use **SuperSocket.WebSocket** in the same way with **SuperWebSocket** but with a different namespace.
